Web Scraping 5k race results with Python and BeautifulSoup

Recently I got installed Anaconda in my laptop, for the open-source fans, Anaconda is a free and open-source distribution of the Python and R programming languages for data science and machine learning related applications (large-scale data processing, predictive analytics and scientific computing).

Iâ€™ve been collecting many packages for data science to practice data wrangling and found this simple and useful tool, called BeautifulSoup, used to web scrap, a technique for extracting datasets from websites.

This, also called data mining technique, extracts data and presents it in a format you can easily use for data analysis.

If you are looking for daily specials from your favorite restaurants, getting the information from different websites can be really a pain. We can make data extraction easier by building a web scraper to get all the information automatically from the Internet.

You can see the Python code I used, for web scraping, using the libraries: BeautifulSoup, Pandas and Numpy.
